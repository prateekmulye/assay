# tests/integration/test_full_graph_mocked.py
"""End-to-end composition test: the REAL compiled graph for both debate modes,
with every LLM call mocked and every tool SDK monkeypatched (via the shared
``offline_graph`` fixture in tests/conftest.py).

This is the 'does the whole system compose' test. It does NOT assert on the
*content quality* of nodes (that is each WP's unit-test job) — it asserts the
graph runs to completion, every contract field is present and shaped correctly,
and metrics accumulate: every graph node emits its per-node metric line.

Metric expectation (COORDINATION.md §7.4 + reality):
  "on"  topology  = 12 graph nodes, each appending >= 1 metric record. The
                    deep-debate (facilitator) and risk (arbiter) nodes ALSO run a
                    bounded sub-debate via run_debate which appends extra records
                    labelled "research_debate" / "risk_debate". So we assert the 12
                    node LABELS are all present (coverage), NOT a brittle exact count.
  "off" topology  = 10 graph nodes (bull/bear/facilitator replaced by a single
                    research_synthesis node). Same coverage assertion on 10 labels.
