/**
 * eventPlayer.ts — the WP-8 REPLAY DRIVER (implemented).
 *
 * The cockpit is a pure function of `AnalysisStreamState`. Two drivers produce
 * that state:
 *   1. LIVE   — useAnalysisStream reduces a real SSE stream.
 *   2. REPLAY — useEventPlayer (here) reduces a recorded RunDetail.events[] list
 *               through the SAME reducer (analysisReducer), on a timer, to
 *               re-create the exact live trajectory at playback speed.
 *
 * Because both terminate in identical state, <Cockpit/> never knows which one is
 * driving it. CockpitDriver captures the `{state, isActive}` equivalence.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *   - SEEK is a pure re-reduce: fold every step whose synthetic offset <= target
 *     time from the initial state. The reducer is cheap and pure, so scrubbing is
 *     instant — and visually correct, because seeking reproduces the *causal*
 *     accumulation (cost ticker, node statuses, deltas) rather than interpolating.
 *   - The wall clock is virtualised: we track elapsed playback ms (advanced while
 *     playing, scaled by speed) and derive which steps are "due". One rAF-paced
 *     loop drives both the visible time and the dispatch, so pause/resume/seek
 *     never desync.
 *   - analysisClock is monkeypatched to a deterministic counter during a folded
 *     re-reduce so node lifecycle stamps stay ordered without wall-clock drift.
