/**
 * replayEvents — map a recorded RunDetail.events[] list onto the typed
 * AnalysisEvent stream the cockpit reducer consumes, plus a timing model.
 *
 * The warehouse stores each SSE frame as `{ name, data, ts_ms }` where `data`
 * is the already-parsed payload (carrying its own `{type, run_id, node, …}`).
 * So decoding is just: stringify `data`, hand the synthetic raw frame to the
 * SAME `decodeEvent` the live path uses. (The JSONL fallback shape
 * `{run_id, node, kind, data}` has no `name`/`ts_ms`; we tolerate it but the
 * warehouse path is the real replay fuel.)
 *
 * TIMING — the load-bearing replay decision. Recorded `ts_ms` deltas are real
 * wall-clock gaps; in APP_FAKE_LLM demo mode a whole 12-node run can land in
 * ~40ms, which would replay as an unwatchable instant. We therefore synthesize
 * a cadence: each step's gap is `clamp(realDelta, MIN_STEP, MAX_STEP)`. This
 * preserves ordering and the *relative* rhythm of a slow real run while
 * guaranteeing every node gets enough dwell time for the cockpit's breathe +
 * luminous-accent flash to read — the node-by-node animation that is the demo.
