# src/memory/cache.py
"""Deterministic cross-run verdict cache, backed by the warehouse (WP-2).

Freshness is computed from the stored tz-aware ``ts`` column via a deterministic
``ORDER BY ts DESC`` query keyed by ticker — NOT semantic similarity. This is
the explicit fix for the old code's defect of using similarity search for
recency (the invariant survives the Chroma -> Postgres migration).

The cache is opt-in: when the warehouse is disabled (no ``DATABASE_URL``),
``store_verdict`` is a no-op and ``get_cached_verdict`` returns None. Lookup
errors degrade to None — the cache must never raise into the graph.
