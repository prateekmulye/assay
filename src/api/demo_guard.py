"""Daily demo-run guard for POST /api/analyze (WP-5).

One FastAPI dependency (``demo_guard``) enforces, in order:

  1. **Admin bypass** — ``X-Admin-Token`` compared with
     ``secrets.compare_digest`` against ``settings.admin_token``. Only possible
     when a token is configured; empty/unset means no bypass exists. Admins
     skip BOTH the per-minute limiter and the daily caps.
  2. **Per-minute limiter** — the pre-existing sliding-window limiter
     (``app.state.limiter``, the fast abuse brake). It runs inside this guard
     so admin bypass and ordering live in exactly one place, and so a
     minute-limited burst never burns daily quota.
  3. **Daily caps** — per-IP (``ip:{client_key}``) and ``global`` counters in
     the warehouse ``demo_quota`` table, keyed by UTC day.

Increment-FIRST design (documented choice): the per-IP counter is atomically
upserted+incremented BEFORE its limit comparison, so there is no
check-then-increment race window; the cost is that an over-limit attempt still
consumes IP quota — acceptable for a demo cap, and it makes hammering strictly
unprofitable. The GLOBAL counter is only incremented when the IP counter is
within its limit (same transaction), so one hammering IP can never drain the
shared global pool. The 429 is raised AFTER the session commits, so the
increments always persist.

The guard declares the request body (``AnalyzeRequest``), so schema-invalid
requests 422 before any quota is consumed; the route receives the parsed body
through the dependency.

Degrade contract: warehouse disabled -> the daily caps no-op (the per-minute
limiter still applies); a broken DB logs a warning and FAILS OPEN (a quota
outage must not take down live demos — same ethos as the ingest layer).
