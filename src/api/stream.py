"""Async SSE generator that runs the compiled LangGraph and maps its stream to events.

We drive `build_graph(debate_mode).astream(input, stream_mode=["updates","messages","values"])`.
Because stream_mode is a LIST, LangGraph yields 2-tuples `(mode, chunk)` (verified
against langgraph 1.0.10):

  mode == "updates":  chunk is dict[node_name, state_delta]  -> node_start + node_complete
  mode == "messages": chunk is (message, metadata)           -> token (metadata.langgraph_node)
  mode == "values":   chunk is the full reducer-accumulated state snapshot (kept as final)

The stub graph emits no "messages" chunks (no LLM calls); token events appear once
real nodes land. The terminal `done` event carries final_report + final_decision +
run_metrics taken from the last "values" snapshot (the reducer-accumulated state, so
run_metrics holds all per-node entries — 12 for the on-topology stub graph).
