"""POST /api/analyze — the SSE analysis stream (moved verbatim from main.py).

Event names/payloads are unchanged from the pre-WP-5 root route; only the path
moved. All throttling (admin bypass -> per-minute limiter -> daily demo caps)
lives in the ``demo_guard`` dependency, which also delivers the validated body
(so a 422 never consumes quota). The runs dir is app-scoped (``app.state``),
set by ``create_app``.
