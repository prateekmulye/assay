# WP-11 production image. Four stages:
#   web-builder -> Vite build of the SPA (consumed only by the caddy stage)
#   py-builder  -> self-contained venv with the runtime extras
#   runtime     -> the FastAPI app (compose target: app)
#   caddy       -> Caddy + the built SPA (compose target: caddy)

# ---- Stage 1: build the Vite SPA ------------------------------------------
FROM node:22-slim AS web-builder
WORKDIR /web
COPY web/package.json web/package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY web/ ./
RUN npm run build

# ---- Stage 2: build the python runtime into a self-contained venv ---------
FROM python:3.13-slim AS py-builder
WORKDIR /build
# setuptools package discovery (include = ["src*", "scripts*"]) needs the
# source tree present to build/install the project.
COPY pyproject.toml ./
COPY src ./src
COPY scripts ./scripts
# api+db is the floor (src/api imports src/warehouse, so a bare ".[api]" image
# dies on import — the WP-5 regression). web+data are needed too: the analysts'
# tools (firecrawl, yfinance, tradingview) and the COLLECTOR_ENABLED=1 sweep
# call those SDKs at runtime; without them every analysis degrades to empty.
RUN python -m venv /opt/venv
ENV PATH="/opt/venv/bin:$PATH"
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade pip \
 && pip install --no-cache-dir ".[api,db,web,data]"

# ---- Stage 3: slim runtime (compose service: app) --------------------------
FROM python:3.13-slim AS runtime
RUN useradd -m -u 1000 appuser
WORKDIR /app

# Redis seam + more replicas if needed.
ENTRYPOINT ["/app/docker/entrypoint.sh"]

# ---- Stage 4: edge (compose service: caddy) --------------------------------
FROM caddy:2-alpine AS caddy
# Pull in Alpine security fixes the base image hasn't rebuilt with yet
# (e.g. libcrypto3/libssl3 — trivy gates this image at CRITICAL,HIGH in CI).
RUN apk upgrade --no-cache
