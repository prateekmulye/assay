# prateekmulye.dev — FinResearchAI project copy

Refreshed copy for the portfolio site. The live card is stale (it still describes the
old Pinecone/RAG prototype). Paste-ready; tweak freely.

## Project card (2–3 sentences)

> **FinResearchAI** — a multi-agent equity-research system you can watch think. A
> 12-node LangGraph pipeline streams parallel analysts, a bull/bear debate, and a risk
> debate into a BUY/SELL/HOLD verdict over SSE, persists every run to a Postgres +
> pgvector warehouse, and replays any of them on a timeline. It also ships the
> evaluation its reference paper omits: an A/B harness measuring exactly what the
> debate costs and whether a blind judge prefers its reasoning.

## Case study paragraph

> FinResearchAI started as a question about the *TradingAgents* paper (arXiv
> 2412.20138): the authors show a multi-agent debate pipeline beats baselines, but
> never isolate what the debate itself buys. I built the system as a deliberate subset
> of the paper — three parallel analysts, a bounded bull/bear exchange, a trader, and a
> two-persona risk debate, all passing typed Pydantic state through a LangGraph
> topology that degrades gracefully on any node failure — then added the ablation the
> paper skips: every ticker runs through both a debate-on and a single-pass topology,
> and a blind LLM judge scores which verdict is better reasoned while the harness
> meters the debate's exact cost, latency, and token overhead. The quality signal is
> framed honestly as a judge-preference proxy, not P&L. Around that core sits a
> production app: a FastAPI backend streaming runs over SSE, a write-through Postgres +
> pgvector warehouse with local BGE-small embeddings powering semantic search, a React
> 19 SPA in the "Machined Light" design system (a tungsten-lit graphite instrument)
> with a live agent-graph cockpit and timeline replay, an X (Twitter) social signal
> hard-budgeted to ~$8/month, a
> quota-guarded public demo with a deterministic fake-LLM mode, and a $0/month Docker
> Compose deployment behind a Cloudflare Tunnel (zero open inbound ports) with a
> five-job CI pipeline. Everything runs on open-weight models via Ollama Cloud — no
> OpenAI key, no GPU.
